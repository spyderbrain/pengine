/** <module> Enable CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

This small module allows  for   enabling  Cross-Origin  Resource Sharing
(CORS) for a specific request.  Typically,   this  should be enabled for
ClioPatria  services  such  as  LOD,  SPARQL  and  application  JSON/XML
services you want to have  useable  from   browser  client  code that is
loaded from another domain.

Because CORS is a security risc (see  below), it is disabled by default,
but can be easily through the ClioPatria web-configuration.

Services for which CORS is relevant must   call cors_enable/0 as part of
the HTTP response.  E.g.:

  ==
  my_handler(Request) :-
	....,
	cors_enable,
	reply_json(Response, []).
  ==

@see	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting for understanding
	Cross-site scripting.
@see	http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ for understanding CORS
